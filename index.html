            <p>In the United States, government funding has been crucial for nonprofit cultural organizations to keep their doors open throughout the pandemic. The National Endowment for the Arts undertook a key role in the management of funds that were appropriated by congress to help institutions that were hurt by the emergency shutdowns. A job that they were very suited to do since they have been distributing funds to art institutions for decades.</p>
    
            <p>In total, over $325 million dollars were distributed between 2020-202 distributed to cultural institutions throughout the country. $210 million came from emergency funds that were appropriated through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act in 2020 and the American Rescue Plan in 2021.</p>
    
            <p>The funds impacted more than five million people working in the cultural sectors of the US economy. "We... know that the arts provide comfort, resilience, wisdom, and the means for self-expression and connection, perhaps even more so in difficult times like these," the agency said in a press release.
